# Camel
Camel is a Perl5-based service framework and standardized RPC running in AWS Lambda.

It is a remake of [Laputa](https://github.com/leeym/laputa) which is inspired by [Wealthfront's Query Engine](https://www.slideshare.net/julienwetterwald/wealthfronts-query-engine).

You can simply write a script with ".pl" extension and invoke it with ["qp0p1"](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/20120308wealthfrontsqueryenginesquare-120509010632-phpapp02/95/wealthfronts-query-engine-13-728.jpg?cb=1336526883) serialization.
